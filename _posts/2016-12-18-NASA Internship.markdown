## The Social Life
I would equate a NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) internship to being in a fraternity, without the hazing of course. In the short few months that I spent there, a family-like bond is fostered. I worked very closely with my fellow interns, and constantly participated in bonding activities, like SCUBA diving, retreats, and skydiving. Along with the fellowship, I engaged in countless philanthropic activities. I visited nearby college campuses to give presentations, and other interns traveled to elementary schools to inspire young students, and give back by doing community service projects. Of course, with any fraternity there is rush. NASA interns, as a whole, promote the greatness of the internship through social media, and try to inspire others to apply to the program as relentlessly as a fraternity. While JSC’s intern social life is much like a frat, we always put work first. There are numerous times where I chose to work late, and get ahead on my project, not because I had to, but because I have a passion for what I do.
As you probably know, all fraternities have letters. This includes NASA. The only difference is we welcome others to wear them. Mimicry is the sincerest form of flattery.
By the time the internship is over, and you have to return home, I realized that I’m not leaving JSC to go home, I’m leaving home to go back to my permanent residence. I am constantly surrounded by people who are passionate about the same things as I, and it’s extremely difficult to find others with the same passion. There’s a select few who are willing to listen to me drone on about NASA, the space industry, and my experiences. After the internship, I felt alienated by the people I considered my friends. Many were to jealous to be as excited as I am, or didn’t care about my experiences. I learned to appreciate the people that do, like my family and my fraternity (&Kappa;&Sigma;). I am extremely lucky to have found my passion so early in my career. I aspire to work full-time at Johnson Space Center. It was what I was born to do.

## My Project
I could fill a book about the exciting tasks I undertook as an intern, however, my project has not yet passed through export control, so unfortunately I can only discuss my project in very generic terms.
I mainly worked Orion Flight Software (FSW)  regression testing. I worked with an Orion vehicle simulation called SOCRRATES to exercise flight software using python scripts. I enhanced and maintained the toolchain that invokes the tests, gathers results, and reports metrics. Moreover, I evaluated test failures and worked with subject matter experts on resolutions, along with producing test coverage reports to assist in the Engineering assessment of flight software for the Certification of Flight Readiness for Exploration Mission 1.

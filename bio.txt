I was born and raised in Michigan. I currently goes to Rochester Adams High School and is also a student at Oakland University-- very few students from my high school are given the opportunity to take college classes. I am very enthusiastic about engineering, and more specifically electrical and computer engineering. I joined my high school robotics team my freshman year, and from there I knew I wanted to be an engineer. There’s a famous quote, “Do what you like, and like what you do”. To me, this means finding an occupation where you ask the question, “Am I really getting paid for this?”
